# TicTacToe2
This was a little school project I did. I wanted to make a simple ol' TicTacToe game and bot.  
There's only one method to beat the bot; can you figure it out?
## How to use it
Run main.py and either enter a `1` to play a 1 versus 1 game against a friend or enter a `2` to play against a bot that follows a simple set of rules.
